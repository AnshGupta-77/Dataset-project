# Dataset-project
This project builds an end-to-end data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline for the Indian Flight dataset using Python. It handles missing values, incorrect data types, duplicates, outliers, and irrelevant features, and applies multiple encoding and scaling techniques to create clean, model-ready data for machine learning.
